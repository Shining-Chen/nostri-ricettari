## Using the App
1. Clone the repo
2. Goto the app project folder
3. In the terminal, check NextJS version by `npx next -v`.  
   If you don't have NextJS installed, you will see the following message:
   `Need to install the following packages:`  
   `next@<version number>`  
   `Ok to proceed? (y)`  
   You can press `y` to install.
4. Once installed, start NextJS by `npm run start`.  
   If you see the error `next: command not found`, try `npm i -g next` and then `npm run start` again.
5. Build the NextJS app by `npm run build`.
6. Run the app locally by `npm run dev`.
